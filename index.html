<p style="color:yellow;"><b> Ganeshotsav </b> is a Hindu festival commemorating the birth of the <i> Hindu god Ganesha </i>.The festival is marked with the installation of Ganesha's clay idols privately in homes and publicly on elaborate pandals (temporary stages).Observances include chanting of Vedic hymns and Hindu texts, such as prayers and vrata (fasting).[3] Offerings and prasada from the daily prayers, that are distributed from the pandal to the community, include sweets such as modaka as it is believed to be a favourite of Ganesha. The festival ends on the tenth day after start, when the idol is carried in a
 public procession with music and group chanting, then immersed in a nearby body of water such as a river or sea, called visarjan on the day of Anant Chaturdashi.  
<u> Thereafter the clay idol dissolves and Ganesha is believed to return to his celestial abode. </u>
     
<p style=background-color:Red;"> The festival celebrates Ganesha as the God of New Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles as well as the god of wisdom and intelligence and is observed throughout India, especially in the states such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Goa. Ganesh Chaturthi is also observed in Nepal and by the Hindu diaspora elsewhere such as in Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
 Singapore, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, other parts of the Caribbean, Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, the United States, and Europe. In the Gregorian calendar, Ganesh Chaturthi falls between 22 August and 20 September every year.</p>
 
  <p> Although it was unknown when or where Ganesh Chaturthi was first observed, the public celebration was initiated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak in Pune in the year 1893. At public venues, along with the reading of texts and group feasting, athletic and martial arts competitions are also held.</p>
   
  <h2> Food – An Integral part of the Festivities </h2>
  <dl>
    <dt> Bhog </dt>
    <dd>- Bhog serves a dual purpose. It refers to the food that is served to all those who come to pay their respects to Lord Ganesh and it is also the food that is offered to him during worship. Apart from sweets and other delicacies, fruits are also offered as bhog. However, bananas, being his favourite fruit, take precedence over all the others.</dd>
    <dt> Modak </dt>
    <dd>- This particular sweet is believed to be Lord Ganesh’s all-time favourite. He is in fact referred to as Modakpriya in the scriptures owing to his great love for these sweet dumplings. Hence, on the first day of Ganesh Chaturthi, devotees offer him a bhog of modak. </dd>
    <dt> Puran Poli </dt>
    <dd>- Puran Poli is a traditional Indian stuffed bread. It is basically a flatbread made out of wheat, that has a sweet stuffing which is enhanced with spices like cardamom and nutmeg. </dd>
    <dt> Laddoos </dt>
    <dd>- Along with modak, Lord Ganesha is also said to be very fond of laddoos. The delectable motichoor laddoo is one of the most common form of laddoos offered to him in the bhog. Lord Ganesh is often depicted as holding motichoor laddoos in his hands, whether in pictures or idols, reflecting His immense fondness for them. </dd>
